Description: A collection of reweighted marginal hypothesis tests for clustered data.
    The tests in this collection are clustered analogs to well-known hypothesis tests
    in the classical setting, and are appropriate for data with cluster- and/or group-size 
    informativeness. The syntax and output of functions in this package are modeled after common, 
    recognizable functions native to R.
